## Bootcamp Activity
### Create a Users page list with CRUD functionality. The add and edit can be in a separate pages.

- Create a model called User
  <br> reference for creating model here: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#mvc-and-you-generating-a-model

- In the generated migration file add the ff fields:
  ```
  t.string :firstname
  t.string :lastname
  t.string :username
  t.string :password
  ```
  reference to migration: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#database-migrations

- Add a routes for users using resources
  <br> reference to routes: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#resources-on-the-web

- Create a UsersController with the following methods: index, new, edit, create, update, destroy

- In index page just plot the users properly in a table list. Add a "Add new" button that leads to New page and Edit link/button along with the list that points to Edit page
  <br> reference for Route helper: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#creating-paths-and-urls-from-objects

- In New page create a form to which accepts firstname, lastname, username, password as a fields.
you can use form_with helper and use User.new as a model. Target the create method in controller as the url action.
  <br> after saving data eg: User.save just redirect to page back to index list. eg: `redirect_back_or_to users_path`
  <br> reference: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#binding-a-form-to-an-object

- In Update page same form can be used but use User.find(id) as the model in form_with helper. Target the update method in controller as the url action.
  <br> after saving data eg: User.save just redirect to page back to index list. eg: `redirect_back_or_to users_path`

### Bonus
- Create delete link/button that targets the destroy method in controller. The link can be done this way
```
rails 6 and below: <%= link_to "Delete User", @user, method: "delete", { confirm: "Are you sure?", disable_with: "Processing..." } %>
<br> rails 7 <%= link_to "Delete", user_path(user), data: {turbo_method: :delete, turbo_confirm: 'Are you sure?'} %>
```

- Use partial page for form. name it `_form.html.erb` which can be called in new.html.erb and edit.html.erb. Pass the correct model during render like so
```
render "form", model: @model
```
where @model is defined in controller method
